What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	new folder .git created to track changes
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	contains only files to be commited for one logical commit with coments, and files that are ready
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	i will add one file or concept at a time to the staging area and commit it, 
	not all the files that i changes, but by logic

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	when making new feature, or trying something new
	branches will help to keep the master as a working code, without changes
